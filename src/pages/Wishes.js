          Dear Ausss, <br />
          <br />
          Happy 20th Birthday! Your 20 journey begins now{" "}
          <span style={{ fontSize: "110%" }}>&#128347;</span> Congratulations
          !!!!! It's hard to believe you are already out of your teen years. We
          spend 3/4 of our teenage years together. You have grown well and have
          become a dutiful person both for your parents and for us . And I wish
          that all of your goals, to be able to stay in a stress-free zone and
          to always be beside us (dr ka tok nga atwt ngr su tg tr lol), will be
          achieved. We had our ups and downs but we could pass well by caring
          each other. You're the one who can tell my soul to, who can relate to
          me like no one else, who can give energy in my downs, who can share a
          lot of advices, who can know me better than I probably do. I literally
          appreciate everything you do for me and I have learned a lot of tips
          from you. You're the sweetest, most intelligent, most supportive, most
          protective, and a mature girl for me.You ain't certainly patient for
          everything but for me, you were. Do you know how special you are.
          Thanks a million Aus. Never forget that I'm here for you and will
          always be. We separated from each other for a half of the year. Right?
          But, we can bond again without changing anything. And nothing will
          ever change that. So many tears, jokes, memories, laughter, dreams,
          lwal p yin lwal nay mhu myr, we've come a long way and have much
          further to go. You literally mean so much to me. I love you w
          countless of love ‚ù§ <br />
          <br /> P.S. Don't be sad so much. After this crisis, we gotta
          celebrate your 20th birthday again! OMGGGGG!!!! I didn't know that I
          could write these long and deep romantic letters for you ewww I can't
          read it again :'' [I wanted to talk about these meaningful things but
          I was shy lol] Ahh Btw baby gurl, go to the front of the mirror and
          say "So what? We hot, we young" xD <br />
          <br />
          From your beautiful baby gurl,
          <br /> Juess

          twenty-age days, free of sadness, hatred and every bad things.
          <br />
          <br /> Wow! You have grown into a beautiful young lady (I‚Äôm just
          saying xD ) The world is so lucky to have someone like you, so are we.
          Thank you so much for being my friend. It was such a gift to me, A
          gift, no one but you can give. As I grow old, I found out that we
          don‚Äôt choose our friends, they choose us. And you choose me.
          <span style={{ fontSize: "100%" }}>‚ù§Ô∏è</span> I‚Äôm just so thankful.

          People says 20th birthday is special as much as 18th because it is the
          first year after teens and beginning of a new decade. I know it is
          such a shame to spend this special day at home. But think about it,
          you will have to spend your every birthday hanging out with us in the
          future. So, this year has to be celebrated at home all day with your
          family. Then, the rest of your 20 decade birthday have to be
          CELEBRATED WITH US. So, don‚Äôt be too sad about it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Well, Here it comes, birthday wishes. On this very special day, may
          you be happy. May you have a wonderful decade. May you achieve all of
          your goals in your near future. May you be able to chase your true
          dream. And May you live ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since you‚Äôve turned into 20, you are very officially an adult. You
          will have to encounter more life struggle. I‚Äôll be rooting for you.
          And I‚Äôm always here to help you out. And lastly, I want you to know
          that I love you <span style={{ fontSize: "110%" }}>
