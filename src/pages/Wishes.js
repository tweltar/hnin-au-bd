          Dear Ausss, <br />
          <br /> Your 20 journey begins now{" "}
          <span style={{ fontSize: "110%" }}>&#128347;</span> Congratulations
          !!!!! It's hard to believe you are already out of your teen years. We
          spend 3/4 of our teenage years together. You have grown well and have
          become a dutiful person both for your parents and for us . And I wish
          that all of your goals, to be able to stay in a stress-free zone and
          to always be beside us (dr ka tok nga atwt ngr su tg tr lol), will be
          achieved. We had our ups and downs but we could pass well by caring
          each other. You're the one who can tell my soul to, who can relate to
          me like no one else, who can give energy in my downs, who can share a
          lot of advices, who can know me better than I probably do. I literally
          appreciate everything you do for me and I have learned a lot of tips
          from you. You're the sweetest, most intelligent, most supportive, most
          protective, and a mature girl for me.You ain't certainly patient for
          everything but for me, you were. Do you know how special you are.
          Thanks a million Aus. Never forget that I'm here for you and will
          always be. We separated from each other for a half of the year. Right?
          But, we can bond again without changing anything. And nothing will
          ever change that. So many tears, jokes, memories, laughter, dreams,
          lwal p yin lwal nay mhu myr, we've come a long way and have much
          further to go. You literally mean so much to me. I love you w
          countless of love ❤ <br />
          <br /> P.S. Don't be sad so much. After this crisis, we gotta
          celebrate your 20th birthday again! OMGGGGG!!!! I didn't know that I
          could write these long and deep romantic letters for you ewww I can't
          read it again :'' [I wanted to talk about these meaningful things but
          I was shy lol] Ahh Btw baby gurl, go to the front of the mirror and
          say "So what? We hot, we young" xD <br />
